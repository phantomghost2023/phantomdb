- ✅ Developed query processing pipeline (parser, planner, optimizer, executor)
- ✅ Implemented transaction management with ACID properties

### 2. Distributed Systems Features
- ✅ Built cluster management with automatic node discovery
- ✅ Implemented Raft consensus protocol for data consistency
- ✅ Created data replication mechanisms across cluster nodes
- ✅ Developed elastic scaling with automatic rebalancing
- ✅ Implemented cross-shard query processing
- ✅ Built distributed transaction support with Two-Phase Commit
- ✅ Created Saga pattern implementation for long-running transactions

### 3. API and Observability
- ✅ Developed REST API for external access
- ✅ Implemented metrics collection and monitoring
- ✅ Added tracing capabilities for performance analysis
- ✅ Created health checks and status reporting

### 4. Testing and Verification
- ✅ Built comprehensive test suite for all components
- ✅ Created verification executables to confirm functionality
- ✅ Implemented performance benchmarks
- ✅ Conducted integration testing for end-to-end functionality
