# Phase 2 Implementation Plan

This document outlines the implementation plan for Phase 2: Single-Node Implementation of Phantom-DB.

## Overview

Phase 2 focuses on building a fully functional single-node database implementation with complete SQL compatibility, document model integration, and enhanced transaction support.

## Goals

1. **Complete SQL Compatibility**: Implement full ANSI SQL standard support
2. **Document Model Integration**: Add JSON/BSON-like document storage capabilities
3. **Enhanced Transaction Support**: Implement advanced transaction features
4. **Reliability Features**: Add fault tolerance and monitoring capabilities

## Implementation Priorities

### 1. SQL Compatibility Layer

#### ANSI SQL Standard Support
- Implement SELECT statements with JOINs, subqueries, and complex expressions
- Add support for DDL statements (CREATE, ALTER, DROP)
- Implement advanced DML operations (MERGE, UPSERT)
- Add support for constraints (PRIMARY KEY, FOREIGN KEY, UNIQUE, CHECK)
- Implement advanced data types (DATE, TIME, TIMESTAMP, DECIMAL, etc.)

#### Extended SQL for Modern Use Cases
- Add support for JSON/JSONB data types and operations
- Implement window functions
- Add common table expressions (CTEs)
- Support for recursive queries

#### Stored Procedures and Functions
- Implement procedural language for stored procedures
- Add support for user-defined functions
- Create security framework for procedure execution

### 2. Document Model Integration

#### JSON/BSON-like Document Storage
- Implement native document storage format
- Add document query operators ($eq, $gt, $lt, $in, etc.)
- Support for nested document queries
- Implement document indexing

#### Cross-Document References
- Add support for document references
- Implement referential integrity for documents
- Add join operations between documents and relational tables

#### Document Validation Schemas
- Implement schema validation for documents
- Add support for JSON Schema validation
- Create validation rule engine

### 3. Transaction System Enhancement

#### Enhanced Isolation Level Support
- Implement snapshot isolation
- Add serializable isolation level
- Optimize existing isolation levels

#### Lock Manager Implementation
- Implement granular locking (row-level, page-level, table-level)
- Add deadlock detection and resolution
- Implement lock escalation policies

#### Distributed Transaction Support
- Implement Two-Phase Commit (2PC) protocol
- Add Saga pattern implementation
- Create compensating transaction framework

### 4. Reliability Features

#### Fault Tolerance
- Implement crash recovery mechanisms
- Add data corruption detection
- Create automatic repair processes
- Implement point-in-time recovery

#### Monitoring & Observability
- Add built-in performance metrics
- Implement query performance analysis tools
- Create health monitoring dashboard
- Add audit logging capabilities

## Implementation Approach

### Modular Development
Each major feature will be developed as a separate module with clear interfaces:
- SQL Parser enhancements
- Query Planner extensions
- Execution Engine improvements
- Storage Engine extensions
- Transaction Manager enhancements

### Test-Driven Development
All features will be developed using TDD:
- Write comprehensive unit tests before implementation
- Create integration tests for end-to-end functionality
- Implement performance benchmarks
- Add stress tests for reliability validation

### Documentation-First Approach
All features will be documented before implementation:
- Create technical specifications
- Write user guides
- Develop API documentation
- Update roadmap and tracking documents

## Timeline

### Months 7-8: SQL Compatibility Layer
- Complete ANSI SQL SELECT statement support
- Implement basic DDL statements
- Add constraint support

### Months 9-10: Document Model Integration
- Implement document storage
- Add document query operators
- Create document indexing

### Months 11-12: Transaction System Enhancement
- Implement lock manager
- Add enhanced isolation levels
- Begin distributed transaction support

### Ongoing: Reliability Features
- Implement fault tolerance mechanisms
- Add monitoring and observability tools

## Success Criteria

By the end of Phase 2, the project should have:
1. Full ANSI SQL compatibility
2. Document model integration with query support
3. Enhanced transaction system with advanced features
4. Comprehensive reliability features
5. Complete test coverage for all new functionality
6. Detailed documentation for all implemented features

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- Complexity of SQL standard implementation
- Performance challenges with document queries
- Deadlock detection complexity

### Mitigation Strategies
- Incremental implementation with frequent testing
- Performance benchmarking at each stage
- Code reviews and pair programming for complex components

## Resource Requirements

### Development Resources
- 2-3 full-time developers
- 1 QA engineer
- 1 documentation specialist

### Infrastructure
- Development workstations
- CI/CD pipeline
- Performance testing environment
- Documentation tools

## Dependencies

### External Dependencies
- C++17 compiler support
- CMake build system
- Third-party libraries (if needed)

### Internal Dependencies
- Completed Phase 1 components
- Core architecture decisions
- Existing test framework

## Conclusion

Phase 2 represents a significant step forward in building a production-ready database system. With a clear plan and defined success criteria, the team can systematically implement all required features while maintaining code quality and reliability.
