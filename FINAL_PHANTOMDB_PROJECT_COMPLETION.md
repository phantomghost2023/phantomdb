- B-tree indexes for range queries
- LSM-tree indexes for write-optimized workloads
- Automatic indexing configuration per table

### 3. Query Planner/Optimizer ‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED
- Rule-based query optimizer with filter reordering
- Cost-based optimizer with realistic cost estimation
- Index-aware query planning and execution
- Statistics-based optimization decisions

### 4. Full ACID Semantics ‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED
- Full MVCC with snapshot isolation
- Comprehensive transaction isolation level support
- Distributed transaction support with Two-Phase Commit
- Saga pattern for distributed transactions

### 5. Ecosystem & Tooling ‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED
- Interactive CLI/REPL with autocomplete and query history
