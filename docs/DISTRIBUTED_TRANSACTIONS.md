# Distributed Transactions in Phantom-DB

This document outlines the approach to distributed transactions in Phantom-DB, incorporating insights from empirical analysis of 2PC, Saga Orchestration, and Saga Choreography patterns.

## 1. Introduction

Phantom-DB aims to provide a next-generation database system that combines the reliability of SQL with the flexibility of NoSQL while offering superior performance. A critical component of this vision is implementing robust distributed transaction mechanisms that can handle the consistency vs. availability trade-offs inherent in distributed systems.

## 2. Consistency Models and the CAP Theorem

In distributed systems, the CAP theorem states that a system can only guarantee two of the following three properties:
- **Consistency**: All nodes see the same data at the same time
- **Availability**: The system remains operational despite node failures
- **Partition Tolerance**: The system continues to operate despite network failures

Phantom-DB will implement both CP and AP models to accommodate different use cases:

### 2.1 Two-Phase Commit (2PC) - CP Model
- Ensures **strong consistency** by enforcing that all participating nodes either commit or abort entirely
- Aligns with the **CP model**, prioritizing consistency over availability during network partitions
- Suitable for critical financial operations requiring immediate strong consistency

### 2.2 Saga Pattern - AP Model
- Handles **Long-Lived Transactions (LLT)** by splitting them into a sequence of local transactions
- Guarantees **eventual consistency**, allowing temporary inconsistencies but ensuring convergence
- Aligns with the **AP model**, prioritizing availability and responsiveness

## 3. Transaction Pattern Analysis

Based on empirical analysis of e-commerce systems, we've identified key trade-offs between the patterns:

### 3.1 Design Characteristics

| Metric | 2PC Advantage | Saga Choreography Advantage | Saga Orchestration Weakness |
|--------|---------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|
| Cyclomatic Complexity | Least overall complexity | - | Highest complexity |
| Cognitive Complexity | - | Lowest (most understandable) | - |
| Lines of Code | Fewest total lines | - | - |
| Code Distribution | - | Most equal distribution | - |
| Communication Overhead | - | Least chatty | Most chatty |

### 3.2 Performance Characteristics

| Metric | Best Performer | Key Insight |
|--------|----------------|-------------|
| Response Time & Throughput | Saga Choreography | 34% more TPS than 2PC |
| Resource Utilization | 2PC | Lowest CPU/memory usage |
| Latency under Load | Saga Pattern | Non-blocking nature maintains steady performance |
| Worst-Case Performance | Saga Orchestration | Poor performance with late-stage failures |

### 3.3 Update Scenarios

| Scenario | 2PC/Saga Orchestration | Saga Choreography |
|----------|------------------------|-------------------|
| DTO Changes | Better handling | Risk of data inconsistencies |
| New Service Addition | Easier (centralized) | Complex (decentralized) |

## 4. Operational Trade-Offs

### 4.1 Two-Phase Commit (2PC) Drawbacks

Despite strong consistency guarantees, 2PC has significant operational drawbacks:

1. **Blocking and Scalability Issues**: Resource locking during Prepare/Commit phases inhibits scalability
2. **Single Point of Failure**: Coordinator crash can leave data stores in permanent locked state
3. **Protocol Complexity**: Requires significant development effort for protocol management

### 4.2 Saga Pattern Resilience

Sagas prioritize fault recovery but introduce consistency challenges:

1. **Compensation Mechanism**: Relies on explicitly designed compensating transactions
2. **Lack of True Isolation**: Results visible before compensation, risking data anomalies
3. **Compensating Complexity**: Complex to design, can fail, not always fully reversible
4. **Reliable Messaging**: Requires Transactional Outbox pattern to mitigate dual-write problem

## 5. Phantom-DB Implementation Strategy

### 5.1 Hybrid Transaction Model

Phantom-DB will implement a hybrid approach that leverages the strengths of both patterns:

#### 5.1.1 Use 2PC for Core Operations
- Core financial operations requiring immediate strong consistency
- Settlements, core ledger updates, legal reporting
- Unmatched consistency and auditability for regulatory compliance

#### 5.1.2 Use Saga for Availability-Critical Flows
- Auxiliary, user-facing, latency-sensitive operations
- Mobile transactions, account balance checks, notifications
- Eventual consistency acceptable for these use cases

### 5.2 Implementation Approach

#### 5.2.1 Transaction Coordinator
- Centralized transaction coordinator for 2PC operations
- Decentralized choreography for Saga patterns
- Orchestration layer for complex workflows

#### 5.2.2 Compensation Framework
- Built-in compensating transaction framework
- Automatic compensation triggering on failure
- Manual intervention capabilities for complex cases

#### 5.2.3 Reliable Messaging
- Transactional Outbox pattern implementation
- Message Relay process for guaranteed delivery
- Integration with popular message brokers
