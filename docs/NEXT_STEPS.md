# Next Steps for Phantom-DB Development

Based on the roadmap, here are the recommended next steps for Phase 1: Foundation & Core Architecture.

## Immediate Priorities

### 1. Research Activities
Start with the comparative analysis to inform core architecture decisions:

- [ ] Study failure points in existing databases (SQL/NoSQL)
  - Document findings in research documents using the [RESEARCH_TEMPLATE.md](RESEARCH_TEMPLATE.md)
- [ ] Analyze performance bottlenecks in current systems
- [x] Research consensus algorithms (Raft, Paxos variants)
- [ ] Study distributed transaction patterns

### 2. Core Architecture Decisions
Begin making decisions on the fundamental architecture:

- [ ] Decide on storage engine design (LSM-tree vs. B-tree hybrid)
- [ ] Define query processing architecture
- [ ] Select concurrency control model
- [ ] Choose data serialization format
- [ ] Select consensus algorithm (Raft vs Paxos variants)

## Recommended Approach

### Month 1-2: Research & Analysis
Focus on completing the comparative analysis section of Phase 1:
1. Create detailed research documents for each area using the research template
2. Benchmark existing database systems to understand their strengths and weaknesses
3. Document findings and recommendations

### Month 3-4: Architecture Design
Based on research findings:
1. Finalize core architecture decisions
2. Create detailed design documents for each component
3. Begin prototyping critical components to validate design choices

### Month 5-6: Initial Implementation
Start implementing the foundational components:
1. Set up development environment and tooling
2. Implement basic storage engine components
3. Begin work on query processing foundations

## Suggested First Research Topics

1. **Failure Points in Existing Databases**
   - Study MongoDB's handling of network partitions
   - Analyze PostgreSQL's crash recovery mechanisms
   - Review Cassandra's consistency model trade-offs

2. **Performance Bottlenecks**
   - Compare write performance of LSM-trees vs. B-trees
   - Analyze query optimizer effectiveness in MySQL vs. PostgreSQL
   - Study lock contention in high-concurrency scenarios

3. **Consensus Algorithms**
   - Compare Raft implementation complexity vs. Paxos variants
   - Analyze performance characteristics of each approach
   - Study real-world implementations in etcd, Consul, and Chubby

## Resources Needed

- Access to various database systems for benchmarking
- Performance testing tools and frameworks
- Documentation tools for research findings
- Prototyping environment

## Success Metrics

By the end of Phase 1 (Month 6), we should have:
- Completed all research activities
- Documented core architecture decisions
- Validated key design choices through prototyping
- Established development practices and workflows
- Begun implementation of foundational components
