## Technical Details

### Architecture
The execution engine follows a modular design with a clear separation of concerns:
- **ExecutionEngine**: Main orchestrator for plan execution
- **ExecutionNode**: Base class for all execution operations
- **ExecutionContext**: Context carrying transaction and result information

### Features Implemented
1. **Modular Execution Nodes**: Each operation type has a dedicated execution node class
2. **Tree Execution Model**: Execution nodes can have children, forming execution trees
3. **Transaction Integration**: All operations execute within transaction contexts
4. **Result Propagation**: Results flow through the execution tree
5. **Extensible Design**: New node types can be added without modifying existing code

### Integration Points
- **Query Processor**: Consumes optimized plans and executes them
- **Transaction Manager**: Uses transactions for ACID compliance
- **Storage Engine**: (Future) Will interact with storage for data operations

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files
- `src/query/execution_engine.h` - Header file with class definitions
- `src/query/execution_engine.cpp` - Implementation of execution engine functionality
- `src/query/execution_engine_test.cpp` - Test suite for execution engine
- `src/query/simple_execution_test.cpp` - Simple test for query processor with execution engine
- `docs/EXECUTION_ENGINE_IMPLEMENTATION.md` - Documentation for execution engine implementation
- `docs/EXECUTION_ENGINE_PHASE1_SUMMARY.md` - This summary document

### Modified Files
- `src/query/query_processor.h` - Added transaction manager include
- `src/query/query_processor.cpp` - Integrated execution engine
- `src/query/CMakeLists.txt` - Added execution engine files and tests
- `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` - Updated to include execution engine
- `ROADMAP.md` - Marked execution engine as completed

## Testing

The execution engine includes comprehensive tests that verify:
- Node creation and execution functionality
- Result propagation through execution trees
- Integration with the query processor
- Transaction context handling
- Error handling and edge cases

## Next Steps

Based on the roadmap, the next components to implement are:
1. Enhanced parser support (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE statements)
2. Additional execution node types (JOIN, AGGREGATE, SORT)
3. Plan caching mechanisms
4. Deadlock detection and resolution in transaction system
5. Distributed transaction support

## Lessons Learned

1. **Naming Conflicts**: Careful attention to naming is required when extending existing class hierarchies to avoid conflicts
2. **Integration Complexity**: Integrating new components with existing systems requires careful consideration of dependencies
3. **Modular Design Benefits**: The modular design of execution nodes makes it easy to extend functionality
4. **Test-Driven Development**: Comprehensive tests ensure that new components integrate properly with existing systems

## Code Quality

The implementation follows modern C++ best practices:
- C++17 standard compliance
- RAII principles for resource management
- Smart pointer usage for automatic memory management
- Pimpl idiom for reduced compilation dependencies
- Clear separation of interface and implementation
- Comprehensive error handling
- Extensive documentation
