# Execution Engine Implementation

## Overview

The Execution Engine is a core component of PhantomDB's query processor responsible for executing query plans generated by the query planner and optimizer. It translates logical query plans into physical execution operations that interact with the storage engine and transaction system.

## Architecture

The execution engine follows a modular design with the following key components:

1. **ExecutionNode**: Base class for all execution nodes
2. **ExecutionContext**: Context that carries transaction information and results through the execution tree
3. **ExecutionEngine**: Main engine that orchestrates the execution of query plans

## Implementation Details

### ExecutionNode Hierarchy

The execution engine implements several types of execution nodes:

1. **ExecTableScanNode**: Performs table scans on stored data
2. **ExecFilterNode**: Applies filter conditions to reduce result sets
3. **ExecProjectNode**: Selects specific columns from result sets

Each execution node can have child nodes, forming a tree structure that mirrors the query plan.

### ExecutionContext

The execution context carries:
- Transaction information for concurrency control
- Intermediate and final results
- Execution state information

### Integration with Other Components

The execution engine integrates with:
- **Query Planner**: Consumes logical plans generated by the planner
- **Query Optimizer**: Works with optimized plans
- **Transaction Manager**: Uses transactions for ACID compliance
- **Storage Engine**: Interacts with storage for data retrieval and modification

## Key Features

1. **Modular Design**: Each execution node type is implemented as a separate class
2. **Extensible**: New execution node types can be added without modifying existing code
3. **Transaction-Aware**: All operations are executed within transaction contexts
4. **Result Handling**: Efficient result processing and forwarding between nodes

- `src/query/execution_engine.h`: Header file with class definitions
- `src/query/execution_engine.cpp`: Implementation of execution engine functionality
- `src/query/execution_engine_test.cpp`: Test suite for execution engine
- `src/query/simple_execution_test.cpp`: Simple test for query processor with execution engine

## Testing

The execution engine includes comprehensive tests that verify:
- Node creation and execution
- Result propagation through execution trees
- Integration with the query processor
- Transaction context handling

## Future Enhancements

Planned improvements for the execution engine include:
- Support for additional execution node types (JOIN, AGGREGATE, SORT)
- Parallel execution for improved performance
- Cost-based execution optimization
- Integration with the storage engine for actual data operations
