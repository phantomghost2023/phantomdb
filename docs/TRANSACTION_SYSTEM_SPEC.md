- **State Management**: Track transaction state throughout execution
- **Commit Protocol**: Coordinate the commit process for distributed transactions
- **Abort Handling**: Manage rollback operations and resource cleanup
- **Timeout Management**: Automatic termination of long-running transactions

#### Implementation Details

- **Timestamp Assignment**: Logical or physical timestamps for ordering
- **Resource Tracking**: Monitor locks, memory, and other resources
- **Context Management**: Maintain transaction context across operations
- **Callback Registration**: Register for commit/abort notifications

#### Transaction States
1. **Active**: Transaction is executing operations
2. **Partially Committed**: Transaction has completed but not yet committed
3. **Committed**: Transaction successfully completed
4. **Failed**: Transaction encountered an error
5. **Aborted**: Transaction was rolled back
6. **Terminated**: Transaction resources have been cleaned up

#### Performance Targets
- Transaction creation time: < 1μs
- Commit latency: < 1ms for local transactions
