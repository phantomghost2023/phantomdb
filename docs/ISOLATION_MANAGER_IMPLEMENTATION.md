# Isolation Manager Implementation

## Overview

This document describes the implementation of the isolation manager component for Phantom-DB's transaction system. The isolation manager provides enhanced support for different isolation levels, ensuring data consistency according to ANSI SQL standards.

## Architecture

The isolation manager consists of the following components:

1. **IsolationManager**: Coordinates isolation level enforcement
2. **MVCCManager**: Integrates with isolation manager for version visibility
3. **TransactionManager**: Uses isolation manager for transaction coordination

## Isolation Manager Implementation

### IsolationManager Class

The IsolationManager class provides enhanced support for different isolation levels.

#### Implementation Files:
- [isolation_manager.h](../src/transaction/isolation_manager.h)
- [isolation_manager.cpp](../src/transaction/isolation_manager.cpp)

#### Key Features:
- Isolation level validation
- Read/write operation permissions
- Version visibility determination
- Phantom read prevention for SERIALIZABLE isolation
- Thread-safe operations

#### Public Interface:
```cpp
class IsolationManager {
public:
    IsolationManager();
    ~IsolationManager();
    
    // Initialize the isolation manager
    bool initialize();
    
    // Shutdown the isolation manager
    void shutdown();
    
    // Check if a read operation is allowed under the given isolation level
    bool isReadAllowed(IsolationLevel level, const std::string& key) const;
    
    // Check if a write operation is allowed under the given isolation level
    bool isWriteAllowed(IsolationLevel level, const std::string& key) const;
    
    // Get the visibility predicate for the given isolation level
    bool isVisible(IsolationLevel level, int transactionId, const DataVersion& version) const;
    
    // Handle phantom read prevention for SERIALIZABLE isolation
    bool preventPhantomReads(IsolationLevel level, int transactionId, const std::string& key);
};
```

## Isolation Levels Supported

### READ_UNCOMMITTED
- **Description**: Lowest isolation level, allows dirty reads
- **Implementation**: All versions are visible, including uncommitted ones
- **Anomalies**: Dirty reads, non-repeatable reads, phantom reads

### READ_COMMITTED
- **Description**: Prevents dirty reads, allows non-repeatable reads
- **Implementation**: Only committed versions are visible
- **Anomalies**: Non-repeatable reads, phantom reads

### REPEATABLE_READ
- **Description**: Prevents dirty and non-repeatable reads, allows phantom reads
- **Implementation**: Committed versions are visible with consistent snapshot
- **Anomalies**: Phantom reads

### SERIALIZABLE
- **Description**: Highest isolation level, prevents all anomalies
- **Implementation**: Committed versions are visible with locking for consistency
- **Anomalies**: None

### SNAPSHOT
- **Description**: MVCC-based isolation with snapshot consistency
- **Implementation**: Versions visible at transaction start time
- **Anomalies**: None

## Integration with MVCC Manager

The MVCC manager has been updated to use the isolation manager for better isolation level support:

### Updated Workflow:
1. **Read**: Check if read is allowed, then determine version visibility
2. **Write**: Check if write is allowed
3. **Visibility**: Use isolation manager to determine version visibility
4. **Phantom Prevention**: Use isolation manager to prevent phantom reads

### Implementation Details:
- IsolationManager is managed within the MVCCManager
- Visibility checks are delegated to the IsolationManager
- Phantom read prevention is handled by the IsolationManager

## Integration with Transaction Manager

The transaction manager has been updated to include the isolation manager:

### Updated Workflow:
1. **Initialize**: Create and initialize isolation manager
2. **Begin**: Create transaction with specified isolation level
3. **Execute**: Use isolation manager for read/write validation
4. **Commit/Rollback**: Clean up isolation-related resources

### Implementation Details:
- IsolationManager is managed within the TransactionManager
- Isolation level is stored with each transaction
- Resources are properly cleaned up on shutdown

## Testing

Comprehensive tests have been created for the isolation manager:

### Isolation Tests:
- [isolation_test.cpp](../src/transaction/isolation_test.cpp)

#### Test Coverage:
- Isolation manager creation and initialization
- Read operation permissions for all isolation levels
- Write operation permissions for all isolation levels
- Version visibility for all isolation levels
- Phantom read prevention for SERIALIZABLE isolation

## Build System Integration

The new component is integrated into the CMake build system:

### Updated CMakeLists.txt:
- [src/transaction/CMakeLists.txt](../src/transaction/CMakeLists.txt)

#### Changes:
- Added isolation_manager.cpp to TRANSACTION_SOURCES
- Added isolation_manager.h to TRANSACTION_HEADERS
- Added isolation_test executable

## Design Decisions

### 1. Modular Architecture

The isolation manager is implemented as a separate component to allow:
- Independent development and testing
- Clear separation of concerns
- Reusability across different transaction processing scenarios

### 2. Isolation Level Enforcement

Isolation levels are enforced through:
- **Operation Permissions**: Check if operations are allowed
- **Version Visibility**: Determine which versions are visible
- **Phantom Prevention**: Prevent phantom reads for SERIALIZABLE

### 3. Thread Safety

Thread safety is ensured through:
- Mutex protection for shared data structures
- RAII principles for resource management
- Exception-safe implementation

### 4. Memory Management

Memory management follows these principles:
- Automatic memory management with smart pointers
- Efficient data structures for tracking isolation state
- Minimal memory copying

## Current Limitations

This is a basic implementation with the following limitations:
- Simplified phantom read prevention (tracking only)
- No actual locking for SERIALIZABLE isolation
- No snapshot-based consistency for SNAPSHOT isolation
- No range locking for phantom read prevention
- No predicate locking for SERIALIZABLE isolation

## Next Steps

The next phase of isolation manager development will focus on:

### 1. Enhanced Phantom Read Prevention
- Range locking implementation
- Predicate locking for SERIALIZABLE isolation
- Gap locking for REPEATABLE_READ isolation

### 2. Snapshot Isolation
- Transaction start time tracking
- Snapshot-based version visibility
- Consistent read views

### 3. Locking Mechanisms
- Shared and exclusive locks for SERIALIZABLE
- Intent locks for hierarchical locking
- Lock compatibility matrix implementation

### 4. Deadlock Detection
- Wait-for graph implementation
- Cycle detection algorithms
- Victim selection strategies

## Performance Considerations

The design takes into account several performance considerations:

### 1. Memory Management
- Smart pointer usage for automatic memory management
- Efficient data structures for tracking isolation state
- Minimal memory copying

### 2. Concurrency Performance
- Fine-grained locking where possible
- Lock-free operations for read-heavy workloads
- Efficient conflict detection

### 3. Isolation Overhead
- Minimal overhead for READ_COMMITTED
- Controlled overhead for higher isolation levels
- Efficient visibility determination

## Usage Example

```cpp
#include "isolation_manager.h"
#include "mvcc_manager.h"

using namespace phantomdb::transaction;

int main() {
    // Create and initialize isolation manager
    IsolationManager isolationManager;
    isolationManager.initialize();
    
    // Create a version
    Timestamp timestamp = std::chrono::high_resolution_clock::now();
    DataVersion version(1, timestamp, "data", true);
    
    // Check visibility under different isolation levels
    bool visible1 = isolationManager.isVisible(IsolationLevel::READ_COMMITTED, 2, version);
    bool visible2 = isolationManager.isVisible(IsolationLevel::SERIALIZABLE, 2, version);
    
    std::cout << "READ_COMMITTED visibility: " << visible1 << std::endl;
    std::cout << "SERIALIZABLE visibility: " << visible2 << std::endl;
    
    return 0;
}
```

## Conclusion

This implementation provides the foundation for enhanced isolation level support in Phantom-DB's transaction system. The modular design and clear interfaces make it easy to extend with more sophisticated isolation mechanisms in future development phases.
