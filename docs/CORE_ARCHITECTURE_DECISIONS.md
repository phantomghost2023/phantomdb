# Core Architecture Decisions

This document outlines the core architecture decisions for Phantom-DB based on the research conducted during Phase 1.

## 1. Storage Engine Design

### Decision: Hybrid LSM-tree and B+tree Storage Engine

Based on our research on performance bottlenecks and failure points in existing databases, we've decided to implement a hybrid storage engine that combines the strengths of both LSM-tree and B+tree structures.

### Rationale:
- **LSM-tree advantages**: Excellent write performance, efficient space utilization, good for write-heavy workloads
- **B+tree advantages**: Fast point queries, efficient range scans, good for read-heavy workloads
- **Hybrid approach**: Allows optimization for different workload patterns within the same database

### Implementation Details:
- **Write-optimized component**: LSM-tree structure for high-throughput writes and ingestion
- **Read-optimized component**: B+tree structure for low-latency point queries and range scans
- **Adaptive switching**: Automatic selection of storage structure based on access patterns
- **Unified interface**: Single API for both storage structures with transparent optimization

### Benefits:
- Optimized performance for both read-heavy and write-heavy workloads
- Reduced write amplification compared to pure B+tree implementations
- Better space efficiency than pure LSM-tree implementations
- Adaptive optimization based on actual usage patterns

## 2. Query Processing Architecture

### Decision: Modular, Extensible Query Processing Pipeline

We'll implement a modular query processing architecture that separates parsing, optimization, and execution into distinct, well-defined components.

### Rationale:
- **Modularity**: Enables independent development and testing of components
- **Extensibility**: Allows for easy addition of new query types and optimization strategies
- **Performance**: Enables pipeline parallelization and optimization
- **Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns simplifies debugging and enhancement

### Implementation Details:
- **Query Parser**: Converts SQL and other query languages into internal representation
- **Query Planner**: Generates multiple execution plans and selects the optimal one
- **Query Optimizer**: Applies rule-based and cost-based optimizations
- **Execution Engine**: Executes the optimized plan using various execution strategies
- **Plugin Architecture**: Support for custom functions, operators, and optimization rules

### Benefits:
- High performance through advanced optimization techniques
- Easy extensibility for new query types and languages
- Better debugging and profiling capabilities
- Support for both OLTP and OLAP workloads

## 3. Concurrency Control Model

### Decision: Multi-Version Concurrency Control (MVCC) with Optimistic Enhancement

We'll implement an MVCC-based concurrency control system with optimistic concurrency features for specific use cases.

### Rationale:
- **MVCC advantages**: Reduces lock contention, enables better read performance, supports snapshot isolation
- **Optimistic enhancement**: Improves performance for low-conflict workloads
- **Research findings**: Lock contention and deadlocks are major performance bottlenecks in existing systems

### Implementation Details:
- **Snapshot Isolation**: Default isolation level providing consistent reads without blocking writers
- **Serializable Snapshot Isolation (SSI)**: Optional stronger consistency for critical transactions
- **Lock-free Reads**: Readers never block writers and vice versa
- **Optimistic Transactions**: For low-conflict workloads with automatic fallback to pessimistic mode
- **Deadlock Detection**: Advanced detection and resolution mechanisms

### Benefits:
- Reduced lock contention and improved throughput
- Better performance for read-heavy workloads
- Elimination of most deadlock scenarios
- Flexible isolation levels for different use cases

## 4. Data Serialization Format

### Decision: Schema-aware Binary Format with JSON Compatibility

We'll implement a custom binary serialization format that combines the efficiency of binary encoding with the flexibility of JSON.

### Rationale:
- **Performance**: Binary formats are more efficient than text-based formats
- **Flexibility**: JSON compatibility supports document-oriented use cases
- **Schema evolution**: Support for backward and forward compatibility
- **Research findings**: Serialization overhead can be a significant performance bottleneck

### Implementation Details:
- **Binary Encoding**: Compact binary representation for primitive types
- **Schema Support**: Optional schema definitions for type safety and validation
- **JSON Compatibility**: Transparent conversion to/from JSON for interoperability
- **Compression**: Built-in compression for repetitive data
- **Versioning**: Support for schema evolution with backward compatibility

### Benefits:
- High performance through efficient binary encoding
- Flexibility through JSON compatibility
- Strong typing through schema support
- Efficient storage through compression
- Easy evolution through versioning support

## 5. Distributed Transaction Model

### Decision: Hybrid Transaction Model (2PC + Saga)

Based on our research comparing 2PC and Saga patterns, we'll implement a hybrid approach that uses the appropriate model for each use case.

### Rationale:
- **2PC advantages**: Strong consistency, automatic rollback, audit trails
- **Saga advantages**: Better performance, availability, scalability
- **Research findings**: Different use cases require different consistency models

### Implementation Details:
- **2PC for Critical Operations**: Financial transactions, core ledger updates, legal reporting
- **Saga for User-Facing Operations**: Mobile transactions, account balance checks, notifications
- **Adaptive Selection**: Dynamic selection based on operation type and SLA requirements
- **Unified Interface**: Single API for both transaction models with transparent selection

### Benefits:
- Strong consistency where needed for regulatory compliance
- High performance and availability for user-facing operations
- Flexible selection based on actual requirements
- Unified programming model for developers

## 6. Consensus Algorithm

### Decision: Raft-based Consensus

Based on our research comparing Raft and Paxos variants, we'll implement Raft as our primary consensus algorithm.

### Rationale:
- **Simplicity**: Easier to understand, implement, and maintain
- **Clear Separation**: Well-defined responsibilities for leader election, log replication, and safety
- **Wide Adoption**: Proven in production systems like etcd and Consul
- **Research findings**: Complexity significantly impacts maintainability and operational overhead

### Implementation Details:
- **Leader Election**: Efficient leader election protocols with appropriate timeouts
- **Log Replication**: Reliable log replication with consistency guarantees
- **Safety Mechanisms**: Prevention of split-brain scenarios and data corruption
- **Membership Changes**: Dynamic cluster membership management
- **Performance Optimizations**: Pipelining and batching for high throughput

### Benefits:
- Simpler implementation and maintenance
- Better understandability for developers
- Proven reliability in production systems
- Efficient performance characteristics

## 7. Additional Architecture Decisions

### Memory Management
- **Decision**: Custom memory allocator with object pooling
- **Rationale**: Research showed memory allocation as a significant performance bottleneck
- **Benefits**: Reduced allocation overhead and improved performance

### I/O Subsystem
- **Decision**: Asynchronous I/O with intelligent batching
- **Rationale**: I/O bottlenecks are common in existing systems
- **Benefits**: Better resource utilization and reduced latency

### Network Communication
- **Decision**: Efficient binary protocol with compression
- **Rationale**: Network latency can significantly impact distributed performance
- **Benefits**: Reduced bandwidth usage and improved response times

## Conclusion

These core architecture decisions provide a solid foundation for Phantom-DB that addresses the shortcomings of existing database systems while optimizing for performance, reliability, and developer experience. Each decision is backed by research and designed to work cohesively within the overall system architecture.

The hybrid approaches in storage engine design, transaction models, and other components allow Phantom-DB to adapt to different workload patterns while maintaining high performance across all use cases.
