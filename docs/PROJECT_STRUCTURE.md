## Alignment with Roadmap Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation & Core Architecture (Months 1-6)
- `src/core/` - Core architecture decisions and utilities
- `docs/` - Research findings and design documents

### Phase 2: Single-Node Implementation (Months 7-12)
- `src/storage/` - Storage engine implementation
- `src/query/` - Query processor and optimizer
- `src/transaction/` - Transaction system

### Phase 3: Distributed Architecture (Months 13-18)
- `src/distributed/` - Cluster management, consensus, and replication

### Phase 4: Developer Experience (Months 19-24)
- `src/tools/` - Administration tools and developer utilities
- `src/api/` - API interfaces and client libraries

### Later Phases
- Additional directories will be created as needed for security, ML integration, and other advanced features
