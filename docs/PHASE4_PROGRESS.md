## Summary

We have successfully completed the REST API layer implementation, which provides a web-based interface for interacting with PhantomDB. This is a major milestone in making PhantomDB more accessible to developers.

The REST API implementation includes:
- Full HTTP server with support for standard methods
- JSON request/response handling
- Route matching with path parameters
- Middleware architecture
- Integration with PhantomDB core components
- Comprehensive test suite
- Detailed documentation
- Build and run scripts

With this foundation in place, we can now proceed with implementing client libraries and other developer tools as part of Phase 4.
