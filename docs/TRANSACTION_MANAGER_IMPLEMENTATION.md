# Transaction Manager Implementation

## Overview

This document describes the implementation of the transaction manager component for Phantom-DB. The transaction manager is responsible for ensuring data consistency and isolation through ACID properties implementation.

## Architecture

The transaction manager follows a modular design with the following components:

1. **Transaction**: Represents a single database transaction with state management
2. **TransactionManager**: Coordinates transaction lifecycle and provides ACID guarantees
3. **ConcurrencyControl**: Manages concurrent access to data (future implementation)
4. **LockManager**: Provides traditional locking mechanisms (future implementation)
5. **IsolationLevelManager**: Implements different isolation levels (future implementation)

## Current Implementation Status

This is a placeholder implementation that demonstrates the basic structure and interface of the transaction manager. The actual concurrency control, locking, and isolation level management logic will be implemented in subsequent phases.

### Implemented Components

#### Transaction Class

The Transaction class represents a single database transaction with the following features:
- Unique transaction ID generation
- Isolation level management
- Transaction state tracking

```cpp
class Transaction {
public:
    Transaction(int id, IsolationLevel isolation = IsolationLevel::READ_COMMITTED);
    ~Transaction();
    
    int getId() const;
    IsolationLevel getIsolationLevel() const;
    TransactionState getState() const;
    
    void setState(TransactionState state);
};
```

#### TransactionManager Class

The main interface for the transaction manager, providing methods for:
- Initialization and shutdown
- Beginning new transactions
- Committing transactions
- Rolling back transactions
- Retrieving transactions by ID

```cpp
class TransactionManager {
public:
    TransactionManager();
    ~TransactionManager();
    
    bool initialize();
    void shutdown();
    
    std::shared_ptr<Transaction> beginTransaction(IsolationLevel isolation = IsolationLevel::READ_COMMITTED);
    bool commitTransaction(std::shared_ptr<Transaction> transaction);
    bool rollbackTransaction(std::shared_ptr<Transaction> transaction);
    std::shared_ptr<Transaction> getTransaction(int id) const;
    
private:
    class Impl;
    std::unique_ptr<Impl> pImpl;
};
```

### Design Patterns Used

1. **Pimpl Idiom**: Implementation details are hidden in the Impl class to reduce compilation dependencies
2. **RAII**: Proper resource management through constructors and destructors
3. **Smart Pointers**: Automatic memory management using std::shared_ptr and std::unique_ptr
4. **Thread Safety**: Mutex protection for concurrent access to shared data

## Implementation Details

### TransactionManager.cpp

The implementation uses a private Impl class to encapsulate the internal state and logic:

```cpp
class TransactionManager::Impl {
public:
    bool initialize();
    void shutdown();
    std::shared_ptr<Transaction> beginTransaction(IsolationLevel isolation);
    bool commitTransaction(std::shared_ptr<Transaction> transaction);
    bool rollbackTransaction(std::shared_ptr<Transaction> transaction);
    std::shared_ptr<Transaction> getTransaction(int id) const;
    
private:
    mutable std::mutex mutex_;
    std::atomic<int> nextTransactionId_;
    std::unordered_map<int, std::shared_ptr<Transaction>> transactions_;
};
```

### Key Features

1. **Thread Safety**: All public methods are thread-safe through mutex protection
2. **Atomic ID Generation**: Transaction IDs are generated atomically to ensure uniqueness
3. **Resource Management**: Automatic cleanup of transaction resources
4. **State Management**: Proper tracking of transaction states throughout their lifecycle

## Testing

A basic test suite has been created to verify the functionality of the transaction manager:

### transaction_test.cpp

The test suite includes tests for:
- TransactionManager creation and initialization
- Beginning new transactions
- Committing transactions
- Rolling back transactions
- Retrieving transactions by ID

## Build System Integration

The transaction manager is integrated into the CMake build system:

### CMakeLists.txt

The module's CMakeLists.txt defines:
- Source and header files
- Library target
- Test executable

### Root CMakeLists.txt

The root CMakeLists.txt has been updated to:
- Include the transaction module
- Link the transaction library to the main executable

## Next Steps

The current implementation is a skeleton that demonstrates the basic structure. Future work will include:

1. **Concurrency Control Implementation**
   - Multi-Version Concurrency Control (MVCC)
   - Optimistic concurrency management
   - Snapshot isolation support

2. **Lock Manager Implementation**
   - Shared and exclusive locking
   - Deadlock detection and prevention
   - Lock granularity management

3. **Isolation Level Implementation**
   - READ UNCOMMITTED support
   - READ COMMITTED support
   - REPEATABLE READ support
   - SERIALIZABLE support
   - SNAPSHOT isolation support

4. **Distributed Transaction Support**
   - Two-Phase Commit (2PC) coordination
   - Saga pattern implementation
   - Compensation management

5. **Performance Optimization**
   - Lock striping and latching
   - Object pooling
   - Memory alignment optimization

## Performance Considerations

The design takes into account several performance considerations:

1. **Modular Design**: Components can be optimized independently
2. **Pimpl Idiom**: Reduces compilation times and dependencies
3. **Smart Pointers**: Automatic memory management
4. **Thread Safety**: Minimal locking through efficient synchronization
5. **Atomic Operations**: Lock-free ID generation

## Error Handling

The implementation follows a consistent error handling approach:

1. **Return Codes**: Boolean return values indicate success/failure
2. **Null Pointer Checks**: Proper validation of input parameters
3. **Exception Safety**: Strong exception safety guarantees where possible
4. **Logging**: Diagnostic output for debugging purposes

## Integration with Other Components

The transaction manager is designed to integrate with other Phantom-DB components:

1. **Storage Engine**: Coordinate with storage engine for data access
2. **Query Processor**: Provide transaction context for query execution
3. **Core Module**: Shared utilities and common functionality

## Usage Example

```cpp
#include "transaction_manager.h"

using namespace phantomdb::transaction;

int main() {
    TransactionManager manager;
    manager.initialize();
    
    // Begin a new transaction
    auto transaction = manager.beginTransaction(IsolationLevel::READ_COMMITTED);
    
    if (transaction) {
        // Perform database operations within the transaction
        // ...
        
        // Commit the transaction
        bool success = manager.commitTransaction(transaction);
        
        if (success) {
            std::cout << "Transaction committed successfully" << std::endl;
        } else {
            std::cerr << "Failed to commit transaction" << std::endl;
        }
    } else {
        std::cerr << "Failed to begin transaction" << std::endl;
    }
    
    manager.shutdown();
    return 0;
}
```

## Conclusion

This implementation provides the foundation for the transaction manager component of Phantom-DB. The modular design and clear interface make it easy to extend with full ACID compliance and concurrency control capabilities in future development phases.
