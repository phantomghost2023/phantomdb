## Detailed Implementation Status

### Storage Engine
The storage engine has been fully implemented with all core components:

1. **Write-Ahead Logging (WAL)**
   - Binary log format implementation
   - Thread-safe operations
   - Log rotation and management
   - Recovery mechanisms

2. **Index Management System**
   - Unified interface for different index types
   - B-tree implementation with full CRUD operations
   - Hash table implementation with chaining collision resolution
   - LSM-tree implementation with memtable and SSTable components
   - Automatic flushing and compaction

3. **Garbage Collection**
   - Reference counting for memory management
   - Automatic cleanup of unused resources
   - Thread-safe operations

### Query Processor
The query processor has been fully implemented with all core components:

1. **Query Parser**
   - SQL parsing with AST generation
   - Support for SELECT statements
   - Modular design for extensibility

2. **Query Planner**
   - Execution plan generation
   - Plan node hierarchy (TableScan, Filter, Project, etc.)
   - Cost estimation

3. **Query Optimizer**
   - Rule-based optimization
   - Cost-based optimization
   - Statistics management

4. **Execution Engine**
   - Physical execution of query plans
   - Execution node hierarchy (ExecTableScan, ExecFilter, ExecProject, etc.)
   - Transaction-aware execution
   - Result propagation

### Transaction System
The transaction system has been implemented with core ACID properties:

1. **Transaction Management**
   - Transaction lifecycle management
   - State tracking (ACTIVE, COMMITTED, ABORTED, etc.)

2. **Concurrency Control**
   - Multi-Version Concurrency Control (MVCC)
   - Lock management (shared and exclusive locks)
   - Isolation level support (READ_UNCOMMITTED, READ_COMMITTED, REPEATABLE_READ, SERIALIZABLE, SNAPSHOT)

## Architecture Decisions

### Storage Engine Design
We implemented a hybrid storage engine that combines the benefits of different data structures:
1. **B-tree**: Optimal for read-heavy workloads with range queries
2. **Hash Table**: Best for point lookups with O(1) complexity
3. **LSM-tree**: Ideal for write-heavy workloads with sequential writes

### Query Processing Architecture
We implemented a modular query processor with separate components:
1. **Parser**: Converts SQL to AST
2. **Planner**: Generates execution plans
3. **Optimizer**: Improves plan efficiency
4. **Execution Engine**: Executes plans physically

### Concurrency Control Model
We implemented MVCC with lock-based concurrency control:
1. **MVCC**: Provides versioning for read consistency
2. **Lock Manager**: Prevents conflicts between concurrent transactions
3. **Isolation Manager**: Enforces isolation level semantics

### Consensus Algorithm Selection
Based on our research, we selected Raft for its understandability and practicality:
1. **Raft**: Simpler to understand and implement than Paxos
2. **Strong Consistency**: Provides linearizable operations
3. **Leader Election**: Clear leadership model for decision making

## Technical Achievements

### Code Quality
All implemented components follow modern C++ best practices:
- C++17 standard compliance
- RAII principles for resource management
- Smart pointer usage for automatic memory management
- Pimpl idiom for reduced compilation dependencies
- Template-based generic programming
- Comprehensive error handling
- Extensive documentation

### Testing
Each component has been thoroughly tested:
- Unit tests for individual components
- Integration tests for component interaction
- Comprehensive test coverage
- Edge case validation

### Documentation
Comprehensive documentation has been created:
- Implementation details for each component
- Architecture decisions and rationale
- Usage examples and best practices
- Future enhancement plans

## Next Steps

With Phase 1 completed, we can now move to Phase 2: Single-Node Implementation. The key areas for Phase 2 include:

### Core Features
1. **SQL Compatibility Layer**
   - ANSI SQL standard support
   - Extended SQL for modern use cases
   - Stored procedures and functions

2. **Document Model Integration**
   - JSON/BSON-like document storage
   - Cross-document references
   - Document validation schemas

3. **Transaction System Enhancement**
   - Deadlock detection and resolution
   - Support for distributed transactions (2PC and Saga patterns)

### Reliability Features
1. **Fault Tolerance**
   - Crash recovery mechanisms
   - Data corruption detection
   - Automatic repair processes

2. **Monitoring & Observability**
