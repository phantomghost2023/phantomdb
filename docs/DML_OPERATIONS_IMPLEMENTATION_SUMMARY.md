##### Documentation
- [SUBQUERY_SUPPORT.md](SUBQUERY_SUPPORT.md)
- [SUBQUERY_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md](SUBQUERY_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md)

## Architecture Consistency

All DML operations follow the same architectural pattern:

1. **AST Extension**: Each operation has a dedicated AST node class
2. **Parser Enhancement**: SQL parser recognizes and parses the syntax
3. **Query Planner Extension**: Planner generates appropriate plan nodes
4. **Execution Engine Extension**: Execution engine executes the operations
5. **Testing**: Comprehensive tests for each component
6. **Documentation**: Detailed documentation for each feature

## Supported SQL Syntax

### INSERT Statements
```sql
-- INSERT with explicit columns
INSERT INTO users (id, name, age) VALUES ('1', 'John', '25');

-- INSERT without columns (uses all columns)
INSERT INTO users VALUES ('2', 'Jane', '30');

-- INSERT with multiple rows
INSERT INTO users (id, name, age) VALUES ('3', 'Bob', '35'), ('4', 'Alice', '28');
```

### UPDATE Statements
```sql
-- UPDATE with WHERE clause
UPDATE users SET name = 'John Doe' WHERE id = '1';

-- UPDATE multiple columns
UPDATE users SET name = 'Jane Smith', age = '31' WHERE id = '2';
```

### DELETE Statements
```sql
-- DELETE with WHERE clause
DELETE FROM users WHERE id = '1';

-- DELETE all rows
DELETE FROM users;
```

### SELECT Statements with JOINs
```sql
-- Basic JOIN
SELECT u.name, o.total FROM users u JOIN orders o ON u.id = o.user_id;

-- Multiple JOINs
SELECT u.name, o.total, p.name as product 
FROM users u 
JOIN orders o ON u.id = o.user_id 
JOIN products p ON o.product_id = p.id;
```

### SELECT Statements with Subqueries
```sql
-- Simple subquery
SELECT * FROM (SELECT id, name FROM users) AS subquery;

-- Subquery with column selection
SELECT id, name FROM (SELECT id, name, age FROM users WHERE age > 18) AS adults;

-- Subquery with more complex inner query
SELECT user_id, order_count FROM 
    (SELECT user_id, COUNT(*) as order_count FROM orders GROUP BY user_id) AS user_orders
WHERE order_count > 5;
```

## Integration Testing

All DML operations have been tested for integration with each other:

- INSERT followed by SELECT
- UPDATE followed by SELECT
- DELETE followed by SELECT
- JOINs with subqueries
- Complex queries combining multiple operations

## Performance Considerations

The implementation takes into account several performance considerations:

1. **Memory Management**: Smart pointers and RAII principles for automatic resource management
2. **Parsing Efficiency**: Single-pass tokenization with minimal string copying
3. **Planning Performance**: Simple cost model for fast plan generation
4. **Execution Efficiency**: Modular execution nodes with clear interfaces

## Future Enhancements

Planned improvements for DML operations include:

1. **Advanced INSERT Features**:
   - INSERT ... SELECT statements
   - INSERT ... ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE statements
   - Batch insert optimizations

2. **Advanced UPDATE Features**:
   - UPDATE with JOINs
   - UPDATE with subqueries
   - Batch update optimizations

3. **Advanced DELETE Features**:
   - DELETE with JOINs
   - DELETE with subqueries
   - Batch delete optimizations

4. **Advanced SELECT Features**:
   - Correlated subqueries
   - Subqueries in WHERE clauses (EXISTS, IN, etc.)
   - Subqueries in SELECT lists
   - UNION, INTERSECT, EXCEPT operations
   - Advanced aggregation functions
   - Window functions

5. **Query Optimization**:
   - Cost-based optimization for all DML operations
   - Plan caching
   - Subquery unnesting
   - Predicate pushdown

## Testing Results

## Conclusion

The implementation of all core DML operations provides Phantom-DB with a solid foundation for data manipulation. The consistent architectural approach ensures maintainability and extensibility, while comprehensive testing guarantees reliability. These features enable users to perform all basic database operations with SQL syntax that is compatible with industry standards.
