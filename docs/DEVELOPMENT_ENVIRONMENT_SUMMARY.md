- **Build Scripts**: 
  - [scripts/build.sh](../scripts/build.sh) for Unix-like systems
  - [scripts/build.bat](../scripts/build.bat) for Windows

### 3. Project Structure
- **Core Module**: Basic core functionality with proper encapsulation
- **Storage Module**: Initial structure for storage engine components
- **Test Framework**: Basic testing setup with Google Test integration
- **Main Executable**: Simple main function to verify build

## Implementation Details

### Core Module
The core module provides the foundational functionality for Phantom-DB:
- **Version Management**: Simple version tracking
- **Initialization/Shutdown**: Proper lifecycle management
- **Logging Integration**: spdlog integration for diagnostic output
- **Pimpl Idiom**: Proper encapsulation using the pointer to implementation idiom

### Storage Module
The storage module implements the initial structure for the storage engine:
- **Storage Engine**: Main storage engine class
- **WAL Manager**: Write-ahead logging manager interface
- **Index Manager**: Index management interface
- **Garbage Collector**: Garbage collection interface

### Testing Framework
The testing framework provides a foundation for comprehensive testing:
- **Google Test Integration**: Industry-standard testing framework
- **Modular Tests**: Separate test files for each module
- **CTest Integration**: CMake test runner integration
- **Basic Test Cases**: Simple initialization and functionality tests

## Build Process

### Prerequisites
1. **Git** for version control
2. **CMake** (3.15 or later) for build configuration
3. **Conan** for dependency management
4. **C++ Compiler** with C++17 support

### Build Steps
1. **Clone Repository**: `git clone` the project
2. **Install Dependencies**: `conan install` to install dependencies
3. **Configure Build**: `cmake` to configure the build
4. **Compile**: `cmake --build` to compile the project
5. **Test**: `ctest` to run tests

### Build Scripts
- **Unix**: `./scripts/build.sh` for building on Unix-like systems
- **Windows**: `scripts\build.bat` for building on Windows

## Verification

The setup has been verified with a simple test that:
1. Initializes the core module
2. Initializes the storage engine
3. Reports version and status information
4. Shuts down components properly

This verification confirms that:
- The build system works correctly
- Dependencies are properly configured
- Basic functionality is implemented
- Testing framework is operational

## Next Steps

With the development environment setup complete, the next steps are:

1. **Implement Storage Engine Components**
   - Write-ahead logging implementation
   - Index management system
   - Garbage collection mechanisms

2. **Expand Test Coverage**
   - Add comprehensive unit tests
   - Implement integration tests
   - Set up performance benchmarks

3. **Begin Query Processor Implementation**
   - SQL parser development
   - Query planner implementation
   - Execution engine development

4. **Set Up Continuous Integration**
   - Configure GitHub Actions workflows
   - Implement automated testing
   - Set up code quality checks

## Success Metrics
