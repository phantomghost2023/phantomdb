# Build Status Summary

This document summarizes the current build status of the Phantom-DB project.

## Current Status

The Phantom-DB project has been successfully structured with a modular C++ implementation, but building the project requires additional setup of development tools.

## Implemented Components

### Core Module
- Basic core functionality with version management
- Proper initialization and shutdown procedures
- Pimpl idiom for encapsulation

### Storage Module
- Storage engine framework
- Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) manager implementation
- Index manager interfaces
- Garbage collector interfaces

### Build System
- CMake configuration files for modular build
- Cross-platform support (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- Separate libraries for each module

### Testing
- Simple test for WAL manager functionality
- Framework for expanding test coverage

## Prerequisites for Building

To build the Phantom-DB project, the following tools need to be installed:

1. **CMake** (version 3.15 or later)
2. **C++ Compiler** with C++17 support
3. **Conan** (optional, for dependency management)

## Build Instructions

### Windows
1. Install Visual Studio with C++ development tools
2. Install CMake from https://cmake.org/
3. Install Conan: `pip install conan` (optional)
4. Create build directory: `mkdir build`
5. Change to build directory: `cd build`
6. Configure with CMake: `cmake ..`
7. Build the project: `cmake --build .`

### macOS
1. Install Xcode Command Line Tools: `xcode-select --install`
2. Install CMake: `brew install cmake`
3. Install Conan: `pip install conan` (optional)
4. Create build directory: `mkdir build`
5. Change to build directory: `cd build`
6. Configure with CMake: `cmake ..`
7. Build the project: `cmake --build .`

### Linux
1. Install build tools: `sudo apt install build-essential`
2. Install CMake: `sudo apt install cmake`
3. Install Conan: `pip install conan` (optional)
4. Create build directory: `mkdir build`
5. Change to build directory: `cd build`
6. Configure with CMake: `cmake ..`
7. Build the project: `cmake --build .`

## Current Limitations

### Missing Dependencies
The project currently references external libraries that need to be installed:
- Google Test (for unit testing)
- spdlog (for logging)
- Other dependencies as specified in conanfile.txt

### Build Environment
The build environment has not been fully set up on this system, as evidenced by the missing CMake and Conan installations.

## Next Steps

1. **Install Build Tools**
   - Install CMake and ensure it's in the PATH
   - Install a C++ compiler with C++17 support
   - Install Conan for dependency management

2. **Verify Build**
   - Test the build process with the current implementation
   - Run the WAL manager test to verify functionality

3. **Expand Implementation**
   - Implement index manager functionality
   - Implement garbage collector
   - Add more comprehensive tests

4. **Set Up CI/CD**
   - Configure automated builds and tests
   - Set up code quality checks

## Success Metrics

The build system is considered successful when:
- ✅ CMake configuration successfully generates build files
- ✅ Project compiles without errors
- ✅ WAL manager test executes successfully
- ✅ Main executable builds and runs
- ✅ All dependencies are properly resolved

This build status summary will be updated as the build environment is set up and the project progresses.
