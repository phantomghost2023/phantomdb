## Existing Solutions Analysis

### SQL Databases Performance Bottlenecks

#### PostgreSQL Performance Issues
- **Description**: Open-source relational database known for reliability and extensibility.
- **Common Performance Bottlenecks**:
  - **Lock Contention**: Row-level locking can cause contention under high concurrency, especially with long-running transactions.
  - **Sequential Scans**: Inadequate indexing can force sequential scans on large tables, causing significant performance degradation.
  - **Memory Management**: Improper configuration of shared_buffers, work_mem, and maintenance_work_mem can lead to suboptimal performance.
  - **Write Amplification**: Frequent updates can cause write amplification in the write-ahead log (WAL) and MVCC system.
  - **Statistics Maintenance**: Outdated table statistics can cause the query planner to make suboptimal decisions.
- **Optimization Strategies in Existing Systems**:
  - Proper indexing strategies
  - Query plan analysis using EXPLAIN
  - Regular ANALYZE operations
  - Connection pooling
  - Partitioning large tables

#### MySQL Performance Issues
- **Description**: Popular open-source relational database with multiple storage engines.
- **Common Performance Bottlenecks**:
  - **Buffer Pool Contention**: InnoDB's buffer pool can become a contention point under high concurrency.
  - **Index Fragmentation**: Over time, indexes can become fragmented, leading to slower query performance.
  - **Query Cache Invalidation**: In MySQL versions that still have query cache, frequent updates can cause cache invalidation overhead.
  - **Join Operations**: Complex join operations without proper indexing can be extremely slow.
  - **Temporary Tables**: Queries that require temporary tables can cause disk I/O if they exceed memory limits.
- **Optimization Strategies in Existing Systems**:
  - Proper buffer pool sizing
  - Regular index maintenance
  - Query optimization
  - Proper partitioning strategies
  - Read replicas for read-heavy workloads

#### Oracle Performance Issues
- **Description**: Enterprise-grade relational database with advanced features.
- **Common Performance Bottlenecks**:
  - **Latch Contention**: Internal serialization mechanisms can become bottlenecks under high concurrency.
  - **Shared Pool Fragmentation**: Over time, the shared pool can become fragmented, affecting SQL execution.
  - **Redo Log Switching**: Frequent redo log switches can cause performance issues.
  - **Undo Management**: Improper undo tablespace management can cause performance problems.
  - **Optimizer Statistics**: Outdated or incorrect optimizer statistics can lead to poor execution plans.
- **Optimization Strategies in Existing Systems**:
  - Automatic Shared Memory Management
  - Regular statistics gathering
  - Proper redo log sizing
  - Undo tablespace management
  - SQL tuning advisor

### NoSQL Databases Performance Bottlenecks

#### MongoDB Performance Issues
- **Description**: Document-oriented NoSQL database with horizontal scaling capabilities.
- **Common Performance Bottlenecks**:
  - **Document Growth**: In-place updates are not possible when documents grow, causing relocation and fragmentation.
  - **Index Bloat**: Too many indexes can slow down write operations significantly.
  - **Read/Write Locks**: Although reduced in newer versions, read/write locks can still impact performance.
  - **Memory Pressure**: Working set larger than available RAM can cause significant performance degradation.
  - **Aggregation Pipeline**: Complex aggregation pipelines can consume significant CPU and memory resources.
- **Optimization Strategies in Existing Systems**:
  - Proper document design to minimize growth
  - Index optimization
  - Sharding for horizontal scaling
  - Working set monitoring
  - Aggregation pipeline optimization

#### Cassandra Performance Issues

  - **GC Pauses**: Java garbage collection can cause significant pauses under certain workloads.
  - **Hotspots**: Uneven data distribution can create hotspots that become bottlenecks.
  - **Read Repair Overhead**: Read repairs can add latency to read operations.
  - **Network Latency**: Cross-datacenter replication can introduce significant latency.
- **Optimization Strategies in Existing Systems**:
  - Tuning compaction strategies
  - JVM tuning for GC optimization
  - Proper data modeling for partition keys
  - Using virtual nodes (vnodes)
  - Network optimization

#### Redis Performance Issues
- **Description**: In-memory key-value store with high performance and various data structures.
- **Common Performance Bottlenecks**:
  - **Memory Limitations**: Running out of memory can cause performance degradation or crashes.
  - **Single Thread Limitation**: All operations are performed on a single thread, which can become a bottleneck.
  - **Large Object Operations**: Operations on large objects can block the server.
  - **Network Latency**: High network latency can impact performance for remote clients.
  - **Key Eviction**: Key eviction policies can cause unexpected performance issues.
