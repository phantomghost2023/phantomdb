# Research: Distributed Transaction Patterns

This document presents research findings on distributed transaction patterns, particularly focusing on Two-Phase Commit (2PC) and Saga patterns, to inform Phantom-DB's architecture decisions.

## Research Topic

Analysis of distributed transaction patterns for microservice architectures with application to Phantom-DB's distributed transaction system.

## Objective

To understand the trade-offs between 2PC and Saga patterns in terms of consistency, performance, and operational complexity, and to determine the optimal approach for Phantom-DB's distributed transaction system.

## Methodology

This research is based on empirical analysis from a Master's thesis comparing 2PC, Saga Orchestration, and Saga Choreography in e-commerce applications, supplemented by theoretical analysis of consistency models and the CAP theorem.

## Existing Solutions Analysis

### Two-Phase Commit (2PC)
- **Description**: Traditional approach that ensures atomicity across distributed systems by using a coordinator to manage prepare and commit phases.
- **Strengths**: 
  - Strong consistency guarantees
  - Automatic rollback mechanisms
  - Built-in audit trails
  - Suitable for regulatory compliance
- **Weaknesses**: 
  - Blocking nature affects scalability
  - Single point of failure in coordinator
  - High operational complexity
  - Resource locking during transaction execution
- **Applicability to Phantom-DB**: Ideal for critical financial operations where strong consistency is paramount and regulatory compliance is required.

### Saga Orchestration
- **Description**: Long-Lived Transaction pattern that breaks transactions into local transactions with explicit compensating actions.
- **Strengths**: 
  - Non-blocking operations improve performance
  - Better fault recovery mechanisms
  - Lower resource consumption
  - Higher throughput
- **Weaknesses**: 
  - Complex compensating logic design
  - Lack of true isolation
  - Potential for compensation failures
  - More complex in failure scenarios
- **Applicability to Phantom-DB**: Suitable for user-facing operations where availability and performance are prioritized over immediate consistency.

### Saga Choreography
- **Description**: Decentralized Saga implementation where services communicate through events without a central orchestrator.
- **Strengths**: 
  - Lowest cognitive complexity
  - Most equal code distribution
  - Least communication overhead
  - Best performance in normal operations
- **Weaknesses**: 
  - Complex to modify when adding/removing services
  - Difficult to trace transaction flow
  - Challenging error handling
- **Applicability to Phantom-DB**: Good for simple workflows where service topology is stable and performance is critical.

## Findings

### Performance Analysis
- Saga Choreography demonstrated 34% higher throughput than 2PC (74.6 TPS vs 48.9 TPS)
- 2PC showed better resource utilization with lower CPU and memory consumption
- Under fault scenarios, Saga patterns maintained steady performance while 2PC latency spiked over 150%

### Design Characteristics
- 2PC had the least cyclomatic complexity and fewest lines of code
- Saga Choreography showed the lowest cognitive complexity and most equal code distribution
- Saga Orchestration was the most complex in both cyclomatic complexity and communication overhead

### Update Scenarios
- 2PC and Saga Orchestration are easier to update when adding new services due to centralized control
- Saga Choreography is challenging to modify when service topology changes
- DTO changes can cause data inconsistencies in all patterns but are more problematic in decentralized approaches

## Recommendations

Based on the research, Phantom-DB should implement a hybrid transaction model:

1. **Use 2PC for Core Financial Operations**: Where strong consistency and regulatory compliance are required
2. **Use Saga for Availability-Critical Flows**: For user-facing operations where performance and availability are prioritized
3. **Implement Adaptive Orchestration**: Dynamically select the appropriate transaction model based on operation type and SLA requirements
4. **Provide Developer Tools**: Offer clear guidance and tools to help developers choose the right pattern for their use cases

## Open Questions

1. How to implement seamless switching between transaction models without application code changes?
2. What machine learning approaches can optimize transaction model selection?
3. How to handle compensation failures in Saga patterns effectively?
4. What observability tools are needed to monitor hybrid transaction systems?
