## Supported SQL Syntax Examples

### Complete Database Operations
```sql
-- Data Definition (via storage engine)
CREATE TABLE users (id VARCHAR(10), name VARCHAR(50), age INT);
CREATE INDEX idx_users_name ON users (name);

-- INSERT operations
INSERT INTO users (id, name, age) VALUES ('1', 'John', '25');
INSERT INTO users VALUES ('2', 'Jane', '30');
INSERT INTO users (id, name, age) VALUES ('3', 'Bob', '35'), ('4', 'Alice', '28');

-- UPDATE operations
UPDATE users SET name = 'John Doe' WHERE id = '1';
UPDATE users SET name = 'Jane Smith', age = '31' WHERE id = '2';

-- DELETE operations
DELETE FROM users WHERE id = '1';
DELETE FROM users;

-- SELECT operations
SELECT * FROM users;
SELECT id, name FROM users WHERE age > 25;

-- SELECT with JOINs
SELECT u.name, o.total FROM users u JOIN orders o ON u.id = o.user_id;

-- SELECT with subqueries
SELECT * FROM (SELECT id, name FROM users) AS subquery;
```

## Architecture Consistency

All components follow consistent architectural patterns:

### Core Design Principles
1. **Modularity**: Each component is implemented as a separate, well-defined module
2. **Extensibility**: The design allows for easy addition of new features
3. **Consistency**: All components follow the same architectural patterns
4. **Integration**: All components work seamlessly together
5. **Performance**: Optimized for efficient resource usage and fast operations

### Implementation Pattern
1. **Interface Design**: Clear, well-defined interfaces for each component
2. **Pimpl Idiom**: Reduced compilation dependencies and improved ABI stability
3. **RAII Principles**: Automatic resource management with smart pointers
4. **Thread Safety**: Mutex-protected operations for concurrent access
5. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error reporting and propagation

## Performance Considerations

### Memory Management
- Smart pointers and RAII principles for automatic resource management
