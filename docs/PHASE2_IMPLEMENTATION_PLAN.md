# Phase 2 Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation plan for Phase 2 of the Phantom-DB project: Single-Node Implementation. Building upon the foundation established in Phase 1, Phase 2 focuses on making Phantom-DB a fully functional single-node database system with complete SQL compatibility and enhanced features.

## Phase 2 Goals

1. **Complete SQL Compatibility**: Implement full ANSI SQL standard support
2. **Document Model Integration**: Add JSON/BSON-like document storage capabilities
3. **Enhanced Transaction System**: Implement deadlock detection and distributed transaction support
4. **Reliability Features**: Add crash recovery, data corruption detection, and monitoring
5. **Performance Optimization**: Implement query plan caching and other optimization techniques
