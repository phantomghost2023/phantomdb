# Phase 2 Implementation Plan

This document outlines the detailed implementation plan for Phase 2: Single-Node Implementation of the Phantom-DB project.

## Phase Overview

Phase 2 focuses on implementing the core single-node functionality of Phantom-DB based on the architecture decisions made in Phase 1. This phase is planned for 6 months (Months 7-12) and will deliver a fully functional single-node database system.

## Implementation Priorities

### 1. Core Storage Engine Implementation
The storage engine is the foundation of the database and needs to be implemented first to support other components.

#### Write-Ahead Logging (WAL)
- Implement log-structured storage for transaction durability
- Design efficient log entry format with compression
- Implement log rotation and retention policies
- Ensure crash recovery capabilities
- Optimize for sequential writes

#### Index Management System
- Implement B+tree index for point queries and range scans
- Implement LSM-tree index for write-heavy workloads
- Design index metadata management
- Implement index creation, deletion, and maintenance
- Optimize index operations for concurrent access

#### Garbage Collection and Compaction
- Implement MVCC garbage collection for old versions
- Design compaction strategies for LSM-tree components
- Implement background compaction processes
- Optimize compaction scheduling to minimize performance impact
- Ensure space reclamation efficiency

#### Backup/Restore Mechanisms
- Implement consistent backup capabilities
- Design incremental backup support
- Implement point-in-time recovery
- Ensure backup performance minimally impacts normal operations
- Design restore procedures for disaster recovery

### 2. Query Processor Implementation
The query processor will handle SQL parsing, optimization, and execution.

#### Query Parser and Planner
- Implement SQL parser for ANSI SQL standard support
- Design abstract syntax tree (AST) representation
- Implement query planning for different operation types
- Design plan enumeration for complex queries
- Implement plan caching for repeated queries

#### Optimizer Framework
- Implement rule-based optimization (RBO)
- Implement cost-based optimization (CBO)
- Design statistics collection and maintenance
- Implement join order optimization
- Design optimization rule framework for extensibility

#### Execution Engine
- Implement vectorized execution for analytical queries
- Design row-based execution for transactional queries
- Implement operator framework for different operations
- Optimize memory management during execution
- Implement parallel execution capabilities

### 3. Transaction System Implementation
The transaction system will provide ACID guarantees and concurrency control.

#### ACID Transaction Implementation
- Implement atomicity through WAL
- Implement consistency through constraint checking
- Implement isolation through MVCC
- Implement durability through WAL and fsync
- Design transaction state management

#### Isolation Levels
- Implement READ UNCOMMITTED
- Implement READ COMMITTED
- Implement REPEATABLE READ
- Implement SERIALIZABLE
- Implement SNAPSHOT isolation

#### Deadlock Detection and Resolution
- Implement wait-for graph detection
- Design deadlock resolution strategies
- Implement timeout-based detection
- Optimize detection frequency for performance
- Ensure minimal false positives
