# Research: Failure Points in Existing Databases

This document presents research findings on common failure points in existing databases (both SQL and NoSQL) to inform Phantom-DB's architecture decisions and improve reliability.

## Research Topic

Analysis of failure points and reliability issues in existing database systems to identify areas for improvement in Phantom-DB.

## Objective

To understand common failure modes in existing database systems and develop strategies to address these issues in Phantom-DB's architecture.

## Methodology

This research is based on analysis of documented failure cases, post-mortems from major database providers, academic studies, and real-world incident reports.

## Existing Solutions Analysis

### SQL Databases Failure Points

#### PostgreSQL
- **Description**: Open-source relational database known for reliability and extensibility.
- **Common Failure Points**:
  - **Connection Pool Exhaustion**: Under high load, applications can exhaust available connections, causing system-wide outages.
  - **Lock Contention**: Long-running transactions can cause lock contention, blocking other transactions and degrading performance.
  - **Disk Space Issues**: Transaction logs (WAL) can fill disk space, causing the database to become unresponsive.
  - **Memory Leaks**: Certain operations and extensions can cause memory leaks that accumulate over time.
  - **Replication Lag**: Asynchronous replication can lead to significant lag, causing data inconsistency during failover.
- **Mitigation Strategies in Existing Systems**:
  - Connection pooling tools like PgBouncer
  - Query timeout mechanisms
  - Monitoring and alerting for disk space and replication lag
  - Regular maintenance procedures (VACUUM, ANALYZE)

#### MySQL
- **Description**: Popular open-source relational database with multiple storage engines.
- **Common Failure Points**:
  - **Deadlocks**: InnoDB's deadlock detection can cause transactions to be rolled back unexpectedly.
  - **Buffer Pool Issues**: Improperly sized buffer pools can lead to excessive disk I/O and performance degradation.
  - **Replication Breakage**: Statement-based replication can break due to non-deterministic functions or schema changes.
  - **Table Locking**: MyISAM engine uses table-level locking, which can become a bottleneck.
  - **Crash Recovery**: Recovery process can be slow for large databases with many dirty pages.
- **Mitigation Strategies in Existing Systems**:
  - Row-level locking with InnoDB
  - Proper buffer pool sizing
  - Monitoring replication status
  - Regular backups and recovery testing

#### Oracle
- **Description**: Enterprise-grade relational database with advanced features.
- **Common Failure Points**:
  - **Shared Pool Issues**: Memory management problems in the shared pool can cause performance degradation.
  - **Redo Log Contention**: Insufficient redo log groups or members can cause checkpointing issues.
  - **Latch Contention**: Internal serialization mechanisms can become bottlenecks under high concurrency.
  - **License Compliance**: Complex licensing model can lead to compliance issues and unexpected costs.
  - **Patch Management**: Cumbersome patching process can leave systems vulnerable to known issues.
- **Mitigation Strategies in Existing Systems**:
  - Automatic Shared Memory Management (ASMM)
  - Proper redo log configuration
  - Regular performance tuning
  - License management tools

### NoSQL Databases Failure Points

#### MongoDB
- **Description**: Document-oriented NoSQL database with horizontal scaling capabilities.
- **Common Failure Points**:
  - **Split-Brain Scenarios**: Network partitions can cause multiple nodes to believe they are the primary, leading to data inconsistency.
  - **Memory Pressure**: WiredTiger storage engine can experience performance issues under memory pressure.
  - **Oplog Lag**: Replication lag in the oplog can cause secondaries to fall behind the primary.
  - **Disk I/O Bottlenecks**: Large document operations can cause disk I/O bottlenecks.
  - **Schema Validation Issues**: Complex schema validation rules can cause write operations to fail unexpectedly.
- **Mitigation Strategies in Existing Systems**:
  - Proper replica set configuration with adequate voting members
  - Monitoring oplog lag and disk I/O
  - Proper indexing strategies
  - Regular performance tuning

#### Cassandra
- **Description**: Distributed NoSQL database with high availability and linear scalability.
- **Common Failure Points**:
  - **Consistency Issues**: Eventual consistency model can lead to stale reads if not properly managed.
  - **Compaction Problems**: Improper compaction strategies can cause performance degradation and disk space issues.
  - **GC Pauses**: Java garbage collection can cause significant pauses under certain workloads.
  - **Token Distribution**: Uneven token distribution can cause hotspots and uneven load distribution.
  - **Repair Operations**: Anti-entropy repair operations can be resource-intensive and impact performance.
- **Mitigation Strategies in Existing Systems**:
  - Proper consistency level selection
  - Tuning compaction strategies
  - JVM tuning for GC optimization
  - Using virtual nodes (vnodes) for better token distribution

#### Redis
- **Description**: In-memory key-value store with high performance and various data structures.
- **Common Failure Points**:
  - **Memory Exhaustion**: Running out of memory can cause performance degradation or crashes.
  - **Persistence Issues**: RDB and AOF persistence mechanisms can cause performance issues or data loss.
  - **Single Thread Limitation**: All operations are performed on a single thread, which can become a bottleneck.
  - **Network Partitions**: Sentinel or cluster configurations can experience issues during network partitions.
  - **Key Eviction**: Key eviction policies can cause unexpected data loss if not properly configured.
- **Mitigation Strategies in Existing Systems**:
  - Proper memory management and monitoring
  - Tuning persistence settings
  - Using Redis Cluster for horizontal scaling
  - Configuring appropriate key eviction policies
