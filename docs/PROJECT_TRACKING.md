# Project Tracking

This document tracks the progress of Phantom-DB development against the roadmap.

## Phase 1: Foundation & Core Architecture (Months 1-6)

### Research & Design

#### Comparative Analysis
- [x] Study failure points in existing databases (SQL/NoSQL)
- [x] Analyze performance bottlenecks in current systems
- [x] Research consensus algorithms (Raft, Paxos variants)
- [x] Study distributed transaction patterns
- [x] Analyze Two-Phase Commit (2PC) vs. Saga patterns for microservices

#### Core Architecture Decisions
- [x] Storage engine design (LSM-tree vs. B-tree hybrid)
- [x] Query processing architecture
- [x] Concurrency control model
- [x] Data serialization format
- [x] Distributed transaction model selection (CP vs AP trade-offs)
- [x] Consensus algorithm selection (Raft vs Paxos variants)

### Core Development

#### Storage Engine
- [ ] Write-ahead logging implementation
- [ ] Index management system
