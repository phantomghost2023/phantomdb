# Project Tracking

This document tracks the progress of Phantom-DB development against the roadmap.

## Phase 1: Foundation & Core Architecture (Months 1-6)

### Research & Design

#### Comparative Analysis
- [ ] Study failure points in existing databases (SQL/NoSQL)
- [ ] Analyze performance bottlenecks in current systems
- [x] Research consensus algorithms (Raft, Paxos variants)
- [x] Study distributed transaction patterns
- [x] Analyze Two-Phase Commit (2PC) vs. Saga patterns for microservices

#### Core Architecture Decisions
- [ ] Storage engine design (LSM-tree vs. B-tree hybrid)
- [ ] Query processing architecture
- [ ] Concurrency control model
- [ ] Data serialization format
- [ ] Distributed transaction model selection (CP vs AP trade-offs)
- [ ] Consensus algorithm selection (Raft vs Paxos variants)

### Core Development

#### Storage Engine
- [ ] Write-ahead logging implementation
- [ ] Index management system
- [ ] Garbage collection and compaction
- [ ] Backup/restore mechanisms

#### Query Processor
- [ ] Query parser and planner
- [ ] Optimizer framework
- [ ] Execution engine
