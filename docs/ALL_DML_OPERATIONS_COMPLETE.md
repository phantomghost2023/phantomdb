## Supported SQL Syntax Examples

### Complete DML Operations
```sql
-- INSERT operations
INSERT INTO users (id, name, age) VALUES ('1', 'John', '25');
INSERT INTO users VALUES ('2', 'Jane', '30');
INSERT INTO users (id, name, age) VALUES ('3', 'Bob', '35'), ('4', 'Alice', '28');

-- UPDATE operations
UPDATE users SET name = 'John Doe' WHERE id = '1';
UPDATE users SET name = 'Jane Smith', age = '31' WHERE id = '2';

-- DELETE operations
DELETE FROM users WHERE id = '1';
DELETE FROM users;

-- SELECT with JOINs
SELECT u.name, o.total FROM users u JOIN orders o ON u.id = o.user_id;
SELECT u.name, o.total, p.name as product 
FROM users u 
JOIN orders o ON u.id = o.user_id 
JOIN products p ON o.product_id = p.id;

-- SELECT with subqueries
SELECT * FROM (SELECT id, name FROM users) AS subquery;
SELECT id, name FROM (SELECT id, name, age FROM users WHERE age > 18) AS adults;
SELECT user_id, order_count FROM 
    (SELECT user_id, COUNT(*) as order_count FROM orders GROUP BY user_id) AS user_orders
WHERE order_count > 5;
```

## Architecture Consistency

All DML operations follow the same architectural pattern:

1. **AST Extension**: Each operation has a dedicated AST node class
2. **Parser Enhancement**: SQL parser recognizes and parses the syntax
3. **Query Planner Extension**: Planner generates appropriate plan nodes
4. **Execution Engine Extension**: Execution engine executes the operations
5. **Testing**: Comprehensive tests for each component
6. **Documentation**: Detailed documentation for each feature

## Performance Considerations

The implementation takes into account several performance considerations:

1. **Memory Management**: Smart pointers and RAII principles for automatic resource management
2. **Parsing Efficiency**: Single-pass tokenization with minimal string copying
3. **Planning Performance**: Simple cost model for fast plan generation
4. **Execution Efficiency**: Modular execution nodes with clear interfaces

## Integration Testing Results

All DML operations have been tested for integration with each other:

| Test Case | INSERT | UPDATE | DELETE | JOIN | Subquery | Result |
|-----------|--------|--------|--------|------|----------|--------|
| Individual Operations | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | Pass |
| Sequential Operations | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | Pass |
| Combined Operations | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | Pass |
| Complex Queries | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | Pass |
