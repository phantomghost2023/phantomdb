# Query Processor Implementation

## Overview

This document describes the implementation of the query processor component for Phantom-DB. The query processor is responsible for parsing SQL queries, generating execution plans, optimizing those plans, and executing them to return results.

## Architecture

The query processor follows a modular design with the following components:

1. **QueryParser**: Converts SQL text into an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)
2. **QueryPlanner**: Generates initial execution plans from the AST
3. **QueryOptimizer**: Improves execution plans through rule-based and cost-based optimization
4. **ExecutionEngine**: Executes optimized plans and returns results
5. **CacheManager**: Stores optimized plans and results for performance

## Current Implementation Status

This is a placeholder implementation that demonstrates the basic structure and interface of the query processor. The actual parsing, planning, optimization, and execution logic will be implemented in subsequent phases.

### Implemented Components

#### QueryProcessor Class

The main interface for the query processor, providing methods for:
- Initialization and shutdown
- Query parsing
- Query planning
- Query execution

```cpp
class QueryProcessor {
public:
    QueryProcessor();
    ~QueryProcessor();
    
    bool initialize();
    void shutdown();
    
    bool parseQuery(const std::string& sql, std::string& errorMsg);
    bool planQuery(const std::string& sql, std::string& plan, std::string& errorMsg);
    bool executeQuery(const std::string& sql, std::vector<std::vector<std::string>>& results, std::string& errorMsg);
    
private:
    class Impl;
    std::unique_ptr<Impl> pImpl;
};
```

### Design Patterns Used

1. **Pimpl Idiom**: Implementation details are hidden in the Impl class to reduce compilation dependencies
2. **RAII**: Proper resource management through constructors and destructors
3. **Smart Pointers**: Automatic memory management using std::unique_ptr

## Implementation Details

### QueryProcessor.cpp

The implementation uses a private Impl class to encapsulate the internal state and logic:

```cpp
class QueryProcessor::Impl {
public:
    bool initialize();
    void shutdown();
    bool parseQuery(const std::string& sql, std::string& errorMsg);
    bool planQuery(const std::string& sql, std::string& plan, std::string& errorMsg);
    bool executeQuery(const std::string& sql, std::vector<std::vector<std::string>>& results, std::string& errorMsg);
};
```

## Testing

A basic test suite has been created to verify the functionality of the query processor:

### query_test.cpp

The test suite includes tests for:
- QueryProcessor creation and initialization
- Query parsing
- Query planning
- Query execution

## Build System Integration

The query processor is integrated into the CMake build system:

### CMakeLists.txt

The module's CMakeLists.txt defines:
- Source and header files
- Library target
- Test executable

### Root CMakeLists.txt

The root CMakeLists.txt has been updated to:
- Include the query module
- Link the query library to the main executable

## Next Steps

The current implementation is a skeleton that demonstrates the basic structure. Future work will include:

1. **Query Parser Implementation**
   - Lexical analysis and tokenization
   - Syntax analysis and AST generation
   - Error handling and reporting

2. **Query Planner Implementation**
   - Logical plan generation
   - Physical plan generation
   - Plan enumeration and selection

3. **Query Optimizer Implementation**
   - Rule-based optimization
   - Cost-based optimization
   - Statistics management

4. **Execution Engine Implementation**
   - Operator framework
   - Vectorized execution
   - Memory management

5. **Cache Manager Implementation**
   - Plan caching
   - Result caching
   - Cache invalidation

## Performance Considerations

The design takes into account several performance considerations:

1. **Modular Design**: Components can be optimized independently
2. **Pimpl Idiom**: Reduces compilation times and dependencies
3. **Memory Management**: Uses smart pointers for automatic memory management
4. **Caching**: Plan and result caching for repeated queries
5. **Parallel Execution**: Support for concurrent query execution

## Error Handling

The implementation follows a consistent error handling approach:

1. **Return Codes**: Boolean return values indicate success/failure
2. **Error Messages**: Detailed error messages are returned through reference parameters
3. **Exception Safety**: Strong exception safety guarantees where possible

## Integration with Other Components

The query processor is designed to integrate with other Phantom-DB components:

1. **Storage Engine**: Access to data through the storage interface
2. **Transaction Manager**: Coordination with transaction boundaries
3. **Core Module**: Shared utilities and common functionality

## Usage Example

```cpp
#include "query_processor.h"

using namespace phantomdb::query;

int main() {
    QueryProcessor processor;
    processor.initialize();
    
    std::vector<std::vector<std::string>> results;
    std::string errorMsg;
    
    bool success = processor.executeQuery("SELECT * FROM users", results, errorMsg);
    
    if (success) {
        // Process results
        for (const auto& row : results) {
            for (const auto& cell : row) {
                std::cout << cell << " ";
            }
            std::cout << std::endl;
        }
    } else {
        std::cerr << "Query execution failed: " << errorMsg << std::endl;
    }
    
    processor.shutdown();
    return 0;
}
```

## Conclusion

This implementation provides the foundation for the query processor component of Phantom-DB. The modular design and clear interface make it easy to extend with full parsing, planning, optimization, and execution capabilities in future development phases.
