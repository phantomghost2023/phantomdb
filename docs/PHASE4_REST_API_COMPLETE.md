# Phase 4: REST API Implementation Complete

## Summary

We have successfully completed the implementation of the REST API layer for PhantomDB as part of Phase 4: Developer Experience. This milestone provides a web-based interface for interacting with PhantomDB using standard HTTP methods, making it more accessible to developers and enabling integration with modern web applications.

## Completed Components

1. **RestApi Class**: Main server implementation using Poco C++ libraries
2. **DatabaseManager Class**: Bridge between REST API and PhantomDB core components
3. **REST Server Executable**: Standalone server application
4. **Unit Tests**: Comprehensive test suite for REST API functionality
5. **Documentation**: Detailed implementation documentation
6. **Build and Run Scripts**: Scripts for easy building and deployment

## Key Features Implemented

- Full HTTP server implementation with support for GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH methods
- Route matching with path parameter support
- Middleware architecture for extensibility
- JSON request/response handling
- Thread-safe operation
- Graceful shutdown handling
- Integration with PhantomDB core components

## Technical Details

- Built with Poco C++ libraries for robust HTTP server functionality
- Uses nlohmann/json for JSON parsing and generation
- Integrated with spdlog for comprehensive logging
- Follows modern C++ best practices with smart pointers and RAII
- Thread-safe design using mutexes and atomic operations

## API Endpoints

The REST API provides endpoints for:
- Health checks
- Database operations (create, list, drop)
- Table operations (create, list, drop)
- Data operations (insert, select, update, delete)
- Custom query execution
- Transaction management

## Testing

- Unit tests verify server initialization, route registration, and basic functionality
- Integration with Google Test framework for comprehensive testing
- Test coverage for both RestApi and DatabaseManager components

## Documentation

- Complete implementation documentation in [REST_API_IMPLEMENTATION.md](file:///D:/PhantomGhost/Storage/Media/Media/Projects/MyProjects/PhantomDB/docs/REST_API_IMPLEMENTATION.md)
- Usage examples and API endpoint descriptions
- Future enhancement suggestions
- Build and run instructions

## Build and Run Scripts

- [build_rest_api.bat](file:///D:/PhantomGhost/Storage/Media/Media/Projects/MyProjects/PhantomDB/scripts/build_rest_api.bat): Script to build the REST API server
- [run_rest_api.bat](file:///D:/PhantomGhost/Storage/Media/Media/Projects/MyProjects/PhantomDB/scripts/run_rest_api.bat): Script to run the REST API server

## Next Steps in Phase 4

With the REST API implementation complete, we can now proceed with other components of Phase 4:
- Client library development (Python, JavaScript, Go, Rust)
- Administration tools (web console, CLI)
- Development tools (query debugger, profiler)
- GraphQL integration

## Usage

To run the REST API server:

```bash
# Build the project
scripts\build_rest_api.bat

# Run the REST API server
scripts\run_rest_api.bat
```

The server will start on port 8080 by default and can be accessed using standard HTTP clients or curl.

Example API calls:

```bash
# Health check
curl http://localhost:8080/health

# List databases
curl http://localhost:8080/databases

# Create a new database
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/databases -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"name": "mydb"}'
```

## Conclusion

The completion of the REST API implementation marks a significant milestone in making PhantomDB more accessible to developers. With this web-based interface, developers can now easily interact with PhantomDB using standard HTTP methods, enabling integration with a wide range of applications and tools.

This implementation provides a solid foundation for the remaining components of Phase 4 and demonstrates our commitment to providing an excellent developer experience with PhantomDB.
