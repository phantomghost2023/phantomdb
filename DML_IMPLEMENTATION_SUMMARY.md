# DML Operations Implementation Summary

This document summarizes the implementation of all DML (Data Manipulation Language) operations in PhantomDB: INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE.

## Overview

We have successfully implemented all three core DML operations in PhantomDB following a consistent pattern. Each operation includes components from parsing to execution, with comprehensive testing and documentation.

## Operations Implemented

### 1. INSERT Statements

#### Components:
- **AST**: `InsertStatement` class
- **Parser**: `parseInsertStatement()` method
- **Planner**: `InsertNode` plan node
- **Execution**: `ExecInsertNode` execution node
- **Tests**: Parser, plan, and execution tests
- **Documentation**: `docs/INSERT_STATEMENT_SUPPORT.md`

#### Syntax Support:
```sql
INSERT INTO table_name (column1, column2, ...) VALUES (value1, value2, ...);
INSERT INTO table_name VALUES (value1, value2, ...);
```

### 2. UPDATE Statements

#### Components:
- **AST**: `UpdateStatement` class
- **Parser**: `parseUpdateStatement()` method
- **Planner**: `UpdateNode` plan node
- **Execution**: `ExecUpdateNode` execution node
- **Tests**: Parser, plan, and execution tests
- **Documentation**: `docs/UPDATE_STATEMENT_SUPPORT.md`

#### Syntax Support:
```sql
UPDATE table_name SET column1 = value1, column2 = value2, ... WHERE condition;
UPDATE table_name SET column1 = value1, column2 = value2, ...;  -- Updates all rows
```

### 3. DELETE Statements

#### Components:
- **AST**: `DeleteStatement` class
- **Parser**: `parseDeleteStatement()` method
- **Planner**: `DeleteNode` plan node
- **Execution**: `ExecDeleteNode` execution node
- **Tests**: Parser, plan, and execution tests
- **Documentation**: `docs/DELETE_STATEMENT_SUPPORT.md`

#### Syntax Support:
```sql
DELETE FROM table_name WHERE condition;
DELETE FROM table_name;  -- Deletes all rows
```

## Implementation Pattern

All three operations follow the same implementation pattern:

1. **Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)**: Each operation has a dedicated AST node class that represents the parsed statement
2. **SQL Parser**: Each operation has a dedicated parsing method that converts SQL text into an AST node
3. **Query Planner**: Each operation has a dedicated plan node class that represents the execution plan
4. **Execution Engine**: Each operation has a dedicated execution node class that performs the actual operation
5. **Testing**: Each operation has comprehensive tests covering parsing, planning, and execution
6. **Documentation**: Each operation has detailed documentation explaining its implementation

## Consistency Features

The implementation maintains consistency across all operations:

- **Similar Architecture**: All operations follow the same architectural pattern
- **Consistent Error Handling**: All operations use the same error handling mechanisms
- **Uniform Testing Approach**: All operations have similar test structures
- **Integrated Build System**: All operations are integrated into the same build system
- **Shared Infrastructure**: All operations leverage the same underlying infrastructure (transactions, storage, etc.)

## Files Organization

### Core Implementation Files:
- `src/query/sql_parser.h/cpp` - Contains all AST classes and parsing logic
- `src/query/query_planner.h/cpp` - Contains all plan node classes and planning logic
- `src/query/execution_engine.h/cpp` - Contains all execution node classes and execution logic

### Test Files:
- `src/query/insert_test.cpp`, `update_test.cpp`, `delete_test.cpp` - Parser tests
- `src/query/insert_plan_test.cpp`, `update_plan_test.cpp`, `delete_plan_test.cpp` - Plan tests
- `src/query/insert_execution_test.cpp`, `update_execution_test.cpp`, `delete_execution_test.cpp` - Execution tests

### Documentation Files:
- `docs/INSERT_STATEMENT_SUPPORT.md`
- `docs/UPDATE_STATEMENT_SUPPORT.md`
- `docs/DELETE_STATEMENT_SUPPORT.md`

## Testing Approach

Each operation has been thoroughly tested with:

1. **Parser Tests**: Verify correct parsing of various statement formats
2. **Plan Tests**: Verify correct generation of execution plans
3. **Execution Tests**: Verify correct execution of operations
4. **Integration Tests**: Verify end-to-end functionality

## Build Integration

All operations are integrated into the build system:

- Added to `src/query/CMakeLists.txt`
- Included in the main library build
- Have dedicated test executables
- Integrated with the existing testing framework

## Future Enhancements

Common future enhancements for all DML operations:

1. **Advanced Parsing**: More sophisticated parsing of complex expressions
2. **Query Optimization**: Cost-based optimization for DML operations
3. **Batch Operations**: Support for batch INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE operations
4. **Constraint Handling**: Better handling of foreign key and other constraints
5. **RETURNING Clauses**: Support for RETURNING clauses in all operations
6. **Performance Optimizations**: Various performance improvements

## Conclusion

The implementation of INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE statements in PhantomDB provides a solid foundation for data manipulation capabilities. All operations follow a consistent pattern, are well-tested, and are fully integrated into the existing architecture. This completes the core DML functionality needed for a relational database management system.
