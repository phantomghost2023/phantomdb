# Phantom-DB

A next-generation database system combining SQL's reliability, NoSQL's flexibility, and new architectural innovations for unprecedented performance and developer experience.

## Vision

Phantom-DB aims to solve current database pain points by providing:
- Elimination of vendor lock-in through open standards
- Predictable performance at scale
- Zero-downtime operations for all maintenance
- Intuitive data modeling that evolves with applications
- Built-in caching that doesn't require separate systems
- Automated optimization without manual tuning

## Technical Differentiators

- Hybrid transactional/analytical processing from day one
- Built-in change data capture streams
- Automatic schema evolution with backward compatibility
- Cost-based optimizer that learns from query patterns
- Multi-tenant isolation for SaaS applications

## Roadmap
