## Initialized Components

1. **Git Repository**: Initialized with an initial commit containing all documentation
2. **Documentation**: Comprehensive set of documents to guide development
3. **Project Tracking**: System for tracking progress against the roadmap
4. **Utility Scripts**: Tools for managing project progress
5. **Directory Structure**: Organized structure aligned with roadmap phases

## Next Steps

Based on the roadmap, the immediate priorities are:

### Phase 1: Foundation & Core Architecture (Months 1-6)

1. **Research & Design**:
   - Begin comparative analysis of existing databases
   - Document findings using the provided research template
   - Complete all research tasks in the first 2-3 months

2. **Core Architecture Decisions**:
   - Make decisions on storage engine design
   - Define query processing architecture
   - Select concurrency control model
   - Choose data serialization format

### Recommended Approach

1. Start with the research activities outlined in [docs/NEXT_STEPS.md](docs/NEXT_STEPS.md)
2. Use the [docs/RESEARCH_TEMPLATE.md](docs/RESEARCH_TEMPLATE.md) for all research documentation
3. Track progress in [docs/PROJECT_TRACKING.md](docs/PROJECT_TRACKING.md)
4. Follow the contribution guidelines in [docs/CONTRIBUTING.md](docs/CONTRIBUTING.md)

## Tools & Utilities

### Progress Tracking
Update task progress using the provided scripts:
```bash
# Mark a task as complete
python scripts/update-progress.py "Research & Design" "Study failure points in existing databases (SQL/NoSQL)" complete
```

### Git Workflow
Follow standard Git practices:
```bash
# Create feature branches
git checkout -b feature/research-document

# Commit changes with descriptive messages
git commit -m "Add research document on database failure points"

# Push to remote repository
git push origin feature/research-document
```

## Development Guidelines

1. **Documentation First**: Create design documents before implementing features
2. **Research Driven**: Base decisions on thorough research of existing solutions
3. **Modular Design**: Keep components loosely coupled and well-defined
4. **Progress Tracking**: Regularly update progress in the tracking document
5. **Code Quality**: Follow best practices and maintain high code quality

## Success Criteria for Phase 1

By the end of Phase 1 (Month 6), the project should have:
- Completed all research activities
- Documented core architecture decisions
- Validated key design choices through prototyping
- Established development practices and workflows
- Begun implementation of foundational components

Refer to [docs/NEXT_STEPS.md](docs/NEXT_STEPS.md) for a detailed breakdown of recommended activities and timeline.
