# DELETE Statement Implementation Summary

This document summarizes the implementation of DELETE statement support in PhantomDB.

## Overview

We have successfully implemented DELETE statement support in PhantomDB following the same pattern used for INSERT and UPDATE statements. The implementation includes all necessary components from parsing to execution.

## Components Implemented

### 1. Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)
- Added `DeleteStatement` class to represent DELETE operations in the AST
- Extended the AST node hierarchy to include DELETE statements

### 2. SQL Parser
- Added DELETE token type recognition
- Implemented `parseDeleteStatement()` method to parse DELETE syntax
- Added logic to handle the FROM keyword and optional WHERE clause
- Extended the main parsing logic to recognize DELETE statements

### 3. Query Planner
- Added `DeleteNode` plan node class
- Extended the plan node type enumeration to include DELETE
- Implemented plan generation logic for DELETE statements

### 4. Execution Engine
- Added `ExecDeleteNode` execution node class
- Extended the execution engine to convert DELETE plan nodes to execution nodes
- Implemented execution logic for DELETE operations

### 5. Testing
- Created parser test (`delete_test.cpp`) to verify correct parsing of DELETE statements
- Created plan test (`delete_plan_test.cpp`) to verify correct plan generation
- Created execution test (`delete_execution_test.cpp`) to verify correct execution
- Created a simple integrated test (`delete_simple_test.cpp`) to test the entire flow

### 6. Build System
- Updated CMakeLists.txt to include new source files and test executables
- Added all new test executables to the build configuration

### 7. Documentation
- Created comprehensive documentation in `docs/DELETE_STATEMENT_SUPPORT.md`

## Files Modified/Added

### Modified Files:
1. `src/query/sql_parser.h` - Added DeleteStatement class and forward declaration
2. `src/query/sql_parser.cpp` - Implemented DeleteStatement class and parsing logic
3. `src/query/query_planner.h` - Added DeleteNode class and DELETE plan node type
4. `src/query/query_planner.cpp` - Implemented DeleteNode class and plan generation logic
5. `src/query/execution_engine.h` - Added ExecDeleteNode class
6. `src/query/execution_engine.cpp` - Implemented ExecDeleteNode class and execution logic
7. `src/query/CMakeLists.txt` - Added new test executables

### New Files:
1. `src/query/delete_test.cpp` - Parser test for DELETE statements
2. `src/query/delete_plan_test.cpp` - Plan test for DELETE statements
3. `src/query/delete_execution_test.cpp` - Execution test for DELETE statements
4. `src/query/delete_simple_test.cpp` - Integrated test for DELETE functionality
5. `docs/DELETE_STATEMENT_SUPPORT.md` - Documentation for DELETE statement support
6. `build_and_test_delete.bat` - Build script for testing DELETE functionality
7. `DELETE_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` - This summary document

## Syntax Support

The implementation supports the following DELETE statement syntax:

```sql
DELETE FROM table_name WHERE condition;
DELETE FROM table_name;  -- Deletes all rows
```

Examples:
```sql
DELETE FROM users WHERE id = 1;
DELETE FROM products WHERE price < 10;
DELETE FROM orders;  -- Deletes all rows
```

## Testing

All tests have been created and are ready to run. The tests cover:
- Basic DELETE statement parsing
- DELETE statements with WHERE clauses
- DELETE statements without WHERE clauses (delete all)
- Plan generation for DELETE statements
- Execution of DELETE plans
- Integrated end-to-end testing

## Future Enhancements

Possible future enhancements for DELETE statement support:
- More sophisticated WHERE clause parsing and optimization
- Support for JOINs in DELETE statements
- Batch deletion optimizations
- Foreign key constraint handling
- RETURNING clause support
- LIMIT clause support

## Conclusion

The DELETE statement support has been successfully implemented following the established patterns in PhantomDB. All components have been integrated into the existing architecture, and comprehensive tests have been created to verify functionality.
